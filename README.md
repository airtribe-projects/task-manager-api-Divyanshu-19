# Task Management API Documentation

## 📘 Overview

This project is a simple **Task Management API** built using **Node.js** and **Express**. It allows users to perform **CRUD operations** on tasks, filter tasks by completion status or priority, and sort them by creation date. The data is stored in-memory (i.e., not persisted to a database).

### Features

* Retrieve all tasks
* Retrieve a task by ID
* Filter tasks by completion status
* Sort tasks by creation date (ascending/descending)
* Filter tasks by priority (low, medium, high)
* Create, update, and delete tasks

## 🧰 Getting Started

   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
